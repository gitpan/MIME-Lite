NAME
    MIME::Lite - low-calorie MIME generator

    *WARNING: This is Alpha code. I have not yet fully tested it, and I
    can't guarantee that the interface won't change in the next few releases
    in a non-backwards-compatible manner. It is being provided to the
    community for suggestions and in the hopes that it will be useful.*

SYNOPSIS
        use MIME::Lite;


    Create a single-part message:

        # Create a new single-part message, to send a GIF file:
        $msg = new MIME::Lite 
                   -From    =>'me@myhost.com',
                   -To      =>'you@yourhost.com',
                    Cc      =>'some@other.com, some@more.com',
                    Subject =>'Helloooooo, nurse!',    
                    Type    =>'image/gif',
                    Path    =>'hellonurse.gif';


    Create a multipart message (i.e., one with attachments):

        # Create a new multipart message:
        $msg = new MIME::Lite 
                   -From    =>'me@myhost.com',
                   -To      =>'you@yourhost.com',
                   -Cc      =>'some@other.com, some@more.com',
                   -Subject =>'A message with 2 parts...',
                    Type    =>'multipart/mixed';

        # Add parts (each "attach" has same arguments as "new"):
        attach $msg 
                    Type     =>'TEXT',   
                    Data     =>"Here's the GIF file you wanted";  
        attach $msg 
                    Type     =>'image/gif',
                    Path     =>'aaa000123.gif',
                    Filename =>'logo.gif';


    Output a message:

        # As a string...
        $str = $msg->stringify;

        # To a filehandle (say, a "sendmail" stream...)    
        $msg->print(\*SENDMAIL);


DESCRIPTION
    In the never-ending quest for great taste with fewer calories, we
    proudly present: *MIME::Lite*.

    MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating
    (not parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output a
    simple, decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary
    attachments. It does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME::
    modules installed.

    You can specify each message part as either the literal data itself (in
    a scalar or array), or as a string which can be given to open() to get a
    readable filehandle (e.g., "<filename" or "somecommand|").

    If you need more sophisticated behavior, please get the MIME-tools
    package instead. I will be more likely to add stuff to that toolkit over
    this one.

CHANGES
  Version 1.112

    Added the read_now() manpage, and the binmode() manpage method for our
    non-Unix-using brethren: file data is now read using binmode() if
    appropriate. *Thanks to Xiangzhou Wang for pointing out this bug.*
